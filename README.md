# Pi Coding Agent Handbook

Agentic coding is probably the best thing that's happened since the ChatGPT moment. These tools are how individual builders ship software that used to take teams — and the more we push them, the more high-quality personal software the world gets. That matters.

I've been through the cycle — Aider, Cursor, Claude Code, Amp, OpenCode, Codex, Goose, Kiro, Kilo, Roo — the list goes on. I still use many of them daily. I'd already cut most of my Claude Code time once Amp came along, but with pi I'm feeling like I could finally stop reaching for it altogether.

Let me be honest about one thing. Claude Code is innovative. It was mindblowing for a long time and it's still pushing forward. I respect what it's done for this space. I just don't like its arrogance. That's personal, and you're welcome to disagree. Pi is the opposite — humble, minimal, and trusts you to drive. That's the energy I want to build with.

This handbook is what I wish existed when I started with pi. It covers the philosophy, the architecture, the extension system, the tradeoffs, and the honest gaps. It's opinionated because pi is opinionated, and that's the point.

## What's inside

The core argument for pi, the four-tool architecture, how extensions replace features other agents bake in, the no-MCP stance (and why MCP 2.0 might change the calculus), community packages like oracle and handoff, a fair comparison with Claude Code / Amp / OpenCode / Aider, and a quick start that gets you running on macOS, Linux, or Android via Termux.

12 chapters. Code snippets. Every claim sourced.
